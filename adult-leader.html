            <b>Try over 200 activities:</b>
            From archery and acting to street sports and zorbing, being a Scout gives you the chance to get stuck into
            loads of activities you wouldn’t normally get to do.
        </P>
        <p>
            <b> Make new friends:</b>
            Going to your Scout meetings is a chance to meet up with your mates, have a laugh and do lots of exciting
            activities.You'll meet adventurous people just like you who want to do something a little different.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Have fun:</b>
            Chief Scout Bear Grylls says life is about grabbing opportunities! We agree! Above everything else, Scouting
            is all about enjoying yourself, whatever you're doing – and there'll always be plenty to do!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Get outdoors:</b>
            As a Scout, you get to explore the big outdoors and travel to new places and try new things. Sounds better
            than being stuck in the house with nothing to do, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Learn exciting things:</b>
            Not many people know about the stars at night, how to sail a dinghy or make a sausage stew on a campfire,
            but you soon will! Scouting helps you learn lots of new and amazing skills – and you get to earn badges and
            rewards along the way.
