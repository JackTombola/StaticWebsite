                <h3>About Scouting</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>As Scouts, we believe in preparing young people with skills for life:</b>

                    We encourage young people to do more, learn more and be more. Each week, we help over 460,000 young
                    people aged 6-25 enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and
                    in the future.

                    We’re talking about teamwork, leadership and resilience – skills that have helped Scouts become
                    everything from teachers and social workers to astronauts and Olympians. We help young people
                    develop and improve key life skills.

                    We believe in bringing people together. We celebrate diversity and stand against intolerance,
                    always. We’re part of a worldwide movement, creating stronger communities and inspiring positive
                    futures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>What Scouts do:</b>

                    Young people in the Scouts take part in an exciting programme of activities from kayaking to coding.
                    They develop character skills like resilience, initiative and tenacity; employability skills such as
                    leadership, teamwork and problem solving; and practical skills like cooking and first aid. And
                    research proves it really works. A 2018 report says Scouts are 17% more likely to show leadership
                    skills and work well in teams. They’re a third more likely to support their communities too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> Volunteer today</b>

                    Whether you can spare an hour a month or a day a year, we have hundreds of opportunities both behind
                    the scenes and directly supporting young people. With full support and award winning training, you
                    can volunteer on a flexible basis. Not only is it incredibly rewarding and great fun, you’ll learn
                    some brilliant skills transferable to the workplace too. We welcome volunteers from every community
                    and background. You don’t need to have been a Scout. You just need to believe in a more positive
                    future and the difference we can make together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Get involved</b>

                    Search for your local Group to find out how to develop your skills, learn new ones and be part of
                    the Scouting story.
