            <p>We’re proud to share our latest annual membership figures with you. They show that we’ve had another year
                of growth, including a marked rise in membership and a wave of new sections opening in areas of
                deprivation across the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since 2014, we’ve been focusing on bringing Scouts to some of the UK’s most disadvantaged communities:
                this is part of our strategy to ensure all of the UK’s young people have access to services that allow
                them to develop essential life skills. The new figures reveal that we’ve now opened 1,280 sections in
                areas of deprivation. This means that nearly 20,480 young people from the toughest to reach communities
                are now a part of the UK Scout movement.</p>

            <p>To generate this growth, we’ve employed development officers to work in local communities, seeking out
                community leaders and meeting places, and setting up these new provisions. They then support the new
                sections for a few months to ensure they’re self-sustaining and can continue offering high quality youth
                work once the development team moves onto new challenges.</p>

            <p>Examples of new provisions opened in areas of deprivation in key English regions:

                Young people attending these Scout groups are drawn from the 10% most deprived wards in England.
