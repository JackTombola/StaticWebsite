            <p>We’re proud to share our latest annual membership figures with you. They show that we’ve had another year
                of growth, including a marked rise in membership and a wave of new sections opening in areas of
                deprivation across the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since 2014, we’ve been focusing on bringing Scouts to some of the UK’s most disadvantaged communities:
                this is part of our strategy to ensure all of the UK’s young people have access to services that allow
                them to develop essential life skills. The new figures reveal that we’ve now opened 1,280 sections in
                areas of deprivation. This means that nearly 20,480 young people from the toughest to reach communities
                are now a part of the UK Scout movement.</p>

            <p>To generate this growth, we’ve employed development officers to work in local communities, seeking out
                community leaders and meeting places, and setting up these new provisions. They then support the new
                sections for a few months to ensure they’re self-sustaining and can continue offering high quality youth
                work once the development team moves onto new challenges.</p>

            <p>Examples of new provisions opened in areas of deprivation in key English regions:

                Young people attending these Scout groups are drawn from the 10% most deprived wards in England.

            <p><span>Scouts at the Poles</span></p>
            <p>Scouts often go to the ends of the earth to make things happen. But some take this more literally than
                others. Chris James pulls on his ski boots to discover the stories of Scouts who’ve ventured into the
                frozen wildernesses of the Arctic and Antarctic in search of adventure
            </p>
            <p>
                When Scout Joe Doherty finally reached the South Pole in January 2019, things did not quite go to plan.

                ‘My skis broke on the last day so I had to walk.’ It wasn’t quite the heroic scene he’d imagined six
                years before, when he first had the idea to head for Antarctica.

                Joe’s astonishing achievement – to head up the first Scout-led expedition to ski to the South Pole and
                kite ski back – is yet another milestone in the history of Scouts’ adventures at the poles.

            <p><span><b>10 ways to deal with stress this summer</b></span></p>
            <p> It’s supposed to be a chance to relax, but summer can often be a stressful time. Travel arrangements,
                changes to routine, family dynamics, and, of course, the impending exam results day all take their toll.
                To help you come out the other side of summer smiling, we’ve put together a list of 10 small things that
                might help you beat stress.</p>

                <p><b>Breathing</b></p>

                <p>It sounds simple, but a few deep breaths are probably the easiest and quickest thing to do when stress
                starts to strike. Focusing on your breathing can help take your mind off what’s bothering you, and it
                calms your body down too.</p>

                <p><b>Go for a walk</b></p>

                <p>If you’ve got a few minutes, getting outside into the fresh air can be a great stress reliever. A quick
                walk uses up energy (which can be great if stress makes you antsy) and it can help you refocus.</p>

               <p> <b>Write it down </b></p>

               <p> Especially if you’re feeling overwhelmed, making a list of what’s going on (or what you need to do) can
                be a great starting point. Even just getting stuff down on paper can help clear your head. Once it’s all
                there, you can start planning some solutions. Often, it’s not as bad as you feared once it’s all out in
                the open.</p>

               <p><b>Talk about it</b></p>

                <p>Find someone you trust, and voice your frustrations to them. It’s a bit of a cliché, but a problem
                solved really can be a problem halved – you’re not in it alone, and you’ve got someone else to help you
                get to the other side.</p>

                <p> <b>Eat something tasty</b></p>

                <p>It doesn’t matter if you’re a fruit fiend or devoted to nuts and seeds – there are plenty of foods that
                contain vitamins and minerals that can help relieve stress. If you’ve got time, maybe you could even
                head to the kitchen. Watching ingredients combine and change as they transform into a flapjack, energy
                bar, or soup can be really calming.</p>

                <p><b>Laugh</b></p>

                <p>Sometimes the best way to deal with stress is to take your mind off things for a little while. Thanks to
                the wonders of the internet, you’re never more than a click away from a dog reviewing human food or cats
                falling off things – or finding a funny GIF to put a smile back on your face.</p>

                <p><b>Have a hot drink</b></p>

                <p>It might not be the best tip for a heatwave, but since they’re few and far-between in the UK, a
                comforting hot drink is often relaxing. Give something without caffeine a go (such as camomile or
                peppermint tea), especially if you’re stressed before bed and need to calm down so you can sleep.</p>

               <p> <b>Get some rest</b></p>

                <p>Stress takes its toll on our bodies, and rest is vital to recharge. Give yourself permission to relax,
                and make sure you leave enough time for a good night’s sleep. A bedtime routine can really help – stop
                scrolling social media, and do something calming such as reading or colouring.</p>

                <p><b>Light a candle</b></p>

                <p>Their soothing smell and flickering flame make candles a perfect partner for a relaxing evening. Orange
                could help reduce stress, lavender could help you relax, and vanilla could boost your mood. What’s your
                favourite scent?</p>

                <p><b>Pet an animal</b></p>

                <p>Size doesn’t matter here – a hamster or gerbil can be just as calming as a Great Dane or a pony. If you
                don’t have a pet at home, you could visit a city farm or petting zoo, ask an animal-loving friend if you
                can visit, or just go on a walk around your neighbourhood in hope of encountering a furry friend.</p>

               <p>These tips don’t fix the big stuff, but hopefully they make the moment more manageable. If you’re
                worried, you can always check out childline. They’re there online and on the phone, anytime. </p>
